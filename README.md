# I Defining the design task

The main goal of the project is to create a shooting range database storing, among others: customers,
instructors, shooting ranges, firearms, available packages, information about competitions, etc. 
Customers can use the shooting range after selecting the package that suits them. 
The offer can be used not only by individual customers but also by competitors, children and teenagers

# II User requirements analysis

1) **Customer** – The person purchasing the package, which includes the price, number of shots and weapon.
Before choosing a package, the customer must provide his or her personal data.
He does not directly select the weapon he wants to shoot with because the choice of weapon depends on the selected package.
The instructor is assigned to the client automatically. It is possible that the client will not be able to use the shooting range, e.g. due to competitions taking place.

     • Can choose one of many available packages
     • If he is at the shooting range for the first time, he creates his own account
     • You have the right to update your account details
     • May benefit from advanced levels of training
     • If the customer is a minor, the selection of packages is limited

3) **Seller** - Seller presents available packages to the customer and sells them for a specific price.
Checks customer data and enters it into the database. Based on them, it presents available packages to him.
It can remove and, if necessary, correct errors existing in the database.

     • Provides information about the available offer
     • Sells available packages to customers
     • Enters customer data into the database
     • Informs the client about the assigned instructor
     • Manages the shooting range database
